## Introduction

This folder contains all the implemented code for the 70068 - Scheduling and Resource Allocation coursework. 

## Files Included

- `tabu.py`: Contains the implementation of the Tabu Search algorithm.
- `vns.py`: Contains the implementation of the Reduced Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm.
- `utils.py`: Includes utility functions or helper methods used in the algorithms.
- `test.py`: Contains test cases or examples demonstrating the usage of the implemented algorithms.
- `constants.py`: Holds constant values or configurations used in the algorithms.

## Usage

### Tabu Search (`tabu.py`)

Describe how to use the Tabu Search algorithm implemented in `tabu.py`. Include examples, usage instructions, and any required input/output details.

### Variable Neighborhood Search (`vns.py`)

Explain how to use the Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm implemented in `vns.py`. Provide examples, instructions, and details on how to input parameters or data.

### Utilities (`utils.py` and `constants.py`)
