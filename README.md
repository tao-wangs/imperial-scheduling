## Introduction

This folder contains all the implemented code and printouts for the 70068 - Scheduling and Resource Allocation coursework. 

## Files Included

- `tabu.py`: Contains the full implementation of the Tabu Search algorithm, methods for experimentation and solutions to Question 2.
- `vns.py`: Contains the full implementation of the Reduced Variable Neighbourhood Search algorithm, neighbourhood generation functions and solutions to Question 3.
- `utils.py`: Contains helper methods used in the tabu search and VNS algorithms.
- `constants.py`: Contains the global constant values for computing solutions to Question 2 and 3. Values are corresponding to 
Appendix A and B in the coursework specification, as well as experimental values obtained from Azure VM.    
- `test.py`: Contains test cases for verifying the correctness of the Tabu Search algorithm implementation. 
- `tabu_output.txt`: Printout of the execution of the Tabu Search algorithm. Shows the current solution considered at each iteration of the Tabu Search method and their cost.
- `vns_output.txt`: Printout of the execution of the Reduced Variable Neighbourhood Search algorithm. Shows the current solution considered at each iteration of the VNS method and their cost.

### Question 2 (`tabu.py`)

`python tabu.py`
